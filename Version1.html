		<p>Laugh</p>
		<p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp and the world laughs with you; </p>
		<p>weep</p>
		<p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp and you weep alone; </p>
		<p>For the sad old</p>
		<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp earth</p>
		<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  must borrow its</p>
		<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp mirth;</p>
		<p>but has trouble enough of its own.</p>
		<p>Sing,</p>
		<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp and the hills will answer;</p>
		<p>Sigh,</p>
		<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp it is lost on the air;</p>
		<p>The echoes bound to a joyful sound,</p>
		<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp but shrink from voicing care.</p>

		<br>
		<br>

		<p>Rejoice,</p>
		<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp and men will seek you;</p>
		<p>Grieve,</p>
		<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  and they will turn and go;</p>
		<p>They want full</p>
		<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp measure</p>
		<p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp of your</p>
		<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp pleasure;</p>
		<p>But they do not need your woe,</p>
		<p>Be glad,</p>
		<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp and your friends are many;</p>
		<p>Be sad,</p>
		<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp and you lose them all-,</p>
		<p>There are none to </p>
		<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp decline</p>
		<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp your nectared</p>
		<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp wine</p>
		<p>But alone you must drink life's gall.</p>

		<br>
		<br>

		<p>Feast,</p>
		<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp and your halls are crowded;</p>
		<p>Fast,</p>
		<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp and the world goes by;</p>
		<p>Succeed</p>
		<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp and</p>
		<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp give,</p>
		<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp and it helps you</p>
		<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp live;</p>
		<p>But no man can help you die.</p>
		<p>There is no </p>
		<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp room</p>
		<p>&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp in the halls of </p>
		<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp pleasure</p>
		<p>For a large and lordly train,</p>
		<p>But</p>
		<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp one by one</p>
		<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp we must all file on</p>
		<p>Through the narrow aisles of</p>
		<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp pain.</p>
